$ #Process list#
    This plugin shows the active processes list. You may use F8 to terminate
selected processes, Enter to switch to process window and F3 to view
additional process information.

    Be careful when killing a process. It stops the process immediately, 
and any unsaved information will be lost, so it should be used only when 
absolutely necessary.
